# Simmer-Button

## Overview
The Simmer-Button project is a creative endeavor to implement a button with a shimmer effect using web technologies. It is designed to work exclusively in Chromium-based browsers due to its use of custom properties.

## Features
- **Shimmer Effect**: A visually appealing shimmer animation that runs across the button.
- **Custom Properties**: Utilizes CSS custom properties for easy customization and maintenance.
- **Chromium Compatibility**: Optimized for Chromium browsers, ensuring the best performance and compatibility.

## Usage
To use the Simmer-Button in your project, simply include the `style.css` and `script.js` files in your HTML document. Then, add the button element with the `shimmer` class to your page.

## Example
```html
<button>
    <span class="text">Simmer Button BY Hillary Serel</span>
    <span class="shimmer"></span>
</button>
